# ml_baselines
A machine learning library for the estimation of greenhouse gas baseline timeseries from high-frequency observations.

## Running the Code
To run the code, the required dataset must first be created using [baseline_setup.py](https://github.com/kgerrand/MSciProject/blob/main/baselines_setup.py). This collects the relevant meteorology, concentration data and baseline flags. The meteorological data were taken from the [EMCWF ERA5 reanalyses](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/search?text=ERA5&type=dataset&keywords=((%20%22Product%20type:%20Reanalysis%22%20)%20AND%20(%20%22Variable%20domain:%20Atmosphere%20(surface)%22%20)%20AND%20(%20%22Spatial%20coverage:%20Global%22%20)%20AND%20(%20%22Temporal%20coverage:%20Past%22%20)%20AND%20(%20%22Provider:%20Copernicus%20C3S%22%20))), and the concentration from [AGAGE](https://agage.mit.edu/).
Following the creation of the dataset, the models (as defined in [final models](https://github.com/kgerrand/MSciProject/tree/main/models)) are tested through [quantitative and qualitative evaluation](https://github.com/kgerrand/MSciProject/blob/main/model_evaluation/model_eval.ipynb), as well as by [comparison to a benchmark](https://github.com/kgerrand/MSciProject/blob/main/model_evaluation/benchmark_comparison.ipynb).
